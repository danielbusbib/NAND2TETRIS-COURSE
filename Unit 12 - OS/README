Submitted Files

README - This file.
Array.jack - very simple implementation using memory class methods. 
Keyboard.jack - implemented as described by Shimon in the lectures by using ‘do nothing’ on pressing and registering the key.  
Math.jack - implemented via cool algorithms taught in the lectures and with the new shift ops we built in the course.
 Also we added two_power array for fast access to the powers of 2 that we used in various occasions in our project. 
Memory.jack - we implemented the first fit method as described in the lectures with a linked list. 
Output.jack - we used all the numeric measures described in the book/imp notes to build the output. 
Screen.jack - we used the smart valuation algorithm described in the lecture to build ‘draw line’ 
and then used it to build the rest of the class, using a bit of math class for calculation. 
String.jack - string implementation was quite straight forward as described in the lectures. 
Sys.jack - in our wait function we took inspiration from c language implementation of ‘wait’ with the 200 timer.
